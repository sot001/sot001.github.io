#### ingredients

  - 1 packet of filo pastry
  - 2 medium tomatoes
  - good size onion.

this size recipe will make enough for maybe 2 people depending on how
much you like it. for a bigger size increase the amount of onion and
tomato and use the whole lot of the pastry providing you make more
layers on the bottom than the top as it has to hold together when you
pick it up obviously.

#### method

1.  the oven should be preheated to 200 degrees, this will be written on
    the packet with the recipe they usually give print on the packet.
2.  this will use half your packet of filo, unfold and lay out. take 12
    sheets for the bottom and 10 sheets for the top. ( i\`m guessing
    your sizes are the same as ours when i said half) melt butter or use
    spray oil if you want healthier, but must admit butter works best.
3.  cook the onion and tomato, before laying out your pastry as being
    thin it dries out rather quickly, (you can lay a wet tea towel over
    the pastry to keep it moist. once it dries out it becomes very
    brittle) just fry it up till cooked in a small amount of oil and set
    aside.
4.  now brush your pastry sheet by sheet in the container or oven tray
    till you have the 12 for the bottom
5.  spread the tomato and onion over then begin with the top 10 sheets
    layering over the filling, roll the edges together just till you
    have the filling encased
