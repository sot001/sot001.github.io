on a Windows server,
[Robocopy](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-GB/library/cc733145.aspx)
can be used to simply back local data up to a remote share;

Place the following in a batch file and schedule to run via windows task
scheduler:

    @ECHO OFF
    SETLOCAL
    SET _source=D:\aestiva\cgi-bin\

    SET _dest=\\NAS\e$\Backup\cgi-bin

    SET _what=/COPYALL /ZB /SEC /E

    :: /COPYALL :: COPY ALL file info
    :: /ZB :: copy files in restartable, falling back to Backup mode.
    :: /SEC :: copy files with SECurity
    :: /MIR :: MIRror a directory tree
    :: /E :: copy all subfolders

    SET _options=/R:5 /W:15 /LOG:D:\BackUp\backup.log /NP /NDL /RH:2200-0600 /PF

    :: /R:n :: number of Retries
    :: /W:n :: Wait time between retries
    :: /LOG :: Output log file
    :: /NP :: no progress logging
    :: /NFL :: No file logging
    :: /NDL :: No dir logging
    :: /RH:hhmm-hhmm :: run hours. only operate during these times
    :: /PF :: check time on a per file basis



    ROBOCOPY %_source% %_dest% %_what% %_options%

The above script will copy files only during the specified period. If it
has started a file copy and then the run rime has elapsed before the
copy can complete, it will complete the copy. With a big file, this may
introduce problems.

If you don't want it running after a specified time (ie users log in)
then create a bat filecalled 'kill_robocyp.bat with the following line
in it and run it when you want robocopy to die. It will then continue
the next night

    taskkill /IM robocopy.exe /F
