Following the guide set out
[here](http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/ideal-backups-zbackup) I have
installed zbackup on both the mail server and remote store server.

On the mail server, there is a wrapper script that tar's up the vmail
directory using a password file and creates a datestamped backup file

`` /bin/tar c /var/vmail | /bin/zbackup --password-file ~/.zbackup_password backup /home/zbackup/backups/backup-`date '+%Y-%m-%d'` ``

The wrapper script then rsync's that across to the remote store via
shared keys;

`/bin/rsync -avz /home/zbackup/ zbackup@remote.server:/home/zbackup/gateway/`

It also removes files older than 28 days;

`find /home/zbackup/backups -mtime +28 -exec rm -rf {} \;`

and runs garbage collection afterwards;

`/bin/zbackup gc --password-file ~/.zbackup_password /home/zbackup`

The script is run from cron every night @0150.

On the owncloud server, a similar script runs from the zbackup home
directory that scans through owncloud data directories and backs them
up. Again, the script is run as root
