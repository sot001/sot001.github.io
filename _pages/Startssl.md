To authenticate on startssl.com to get the ball rolling, you will need
to have the correct authentication certificate installed in your
browser. This can be seen within the 'certificates' section of the
browser. Once you have this file, store it somewhere safe (like lastpass
for example) as you're buggered without it.

Generating a new one can be done by following the certificate wizard,
generating the key and csr via openssl. create a new PKCS\#12 file by
selecting that option in the toolbox, providing both the key and csr and
then the password used when generating it.

If you need to renew certificates, first follow through the domain and
email validation steps. This is required before you can do anything
else.

Once that's done, use the Certificate wizard to generate the new
certificates. Choose 'Generated by myself' for the CSR section and use
openssl to generate your CSR and KEY. Then replace the existing
certificates within NGINX as required. The .key file will be the same
one you used to generate the CSR file on the server and the CRT file is
that downloaded from startssl
